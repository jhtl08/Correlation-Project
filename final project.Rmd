# Correlation of CPU Price and Performance

## Introduction
(to be added later)

## Methodology
(to be added later)

## Results
The price and CPU mark (measured by Passmark) of 1,967 different CPUs were analyzed in this study. Here's a scatter plot to visualize:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)

cpuData<-read.csv("CPU_benchmark_v4.csv")

cpuData %>% ggplot(aes(x = cpuMark, y = price)) + geom_point()+ theme_bw()

```



In this analysis, the correlation between CPU price and performance will be tested with Î±= 0.05 (95% confidence interval).
